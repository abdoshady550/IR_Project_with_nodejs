Preface
How This Book Was Written-and 
Why
Thirty-Five years ago, I was one of 
the unhappiest lads in New York. I 
was selling motortrucks for a living. 
I didn't know what made a motortruck run. That wasn't all: I didn't
want to know. I despised my job. I 
despised living in a cheap furnished 
room on West
Fifty-sixth Street-a room infested 
with cockroaches. I still remember 
that I had a bunch
of neckties hanging on the walls; and 
when I reached out of a morning to 
get a fresh
necktie, the cockroaches scattered in 
all directions. I despised having to 
eat in cheap,
dirty restaurants that were also 
probably infested with cockroaches.
I came home to my lonely room each 
night with a sick headache-a 
headache bred and
fed by disappointment, worry, 
bitterness, and rebellion. I was 
rebelling because the
dreams I had nourished back in my 
college days had turned into 
nightmares. Was this
life? Was this the vital adventure to
which I had looked forward so 
eagerly? Was this all
life would ever mean to me-working 
at a job I despised, living with 
cockroaches, eating
vile food-and with no hope for the 
future? ... I longed for leisure to read, 
and to write
the books I had dreamed of writing 
back in my college days.
I knew I had everything to gain and 
nothing to lose by giving up the job I 
despised. I
wasn't interested in making a lot of 
money, but I was interested in 
making a lot of
living. In short, I had come to the 
Rubicon-to that moment of decision 
which faces most
young people when they start out in 
life. So I made my decision-and that 
decision
completely altered my future. It has 
made the last thirty-five years happy 
and
rewarding beyond my most Utopian 
aspirations.
My decision was this: I would give 
up the work I loathed; and, since I 
had spent four
years studying in the State Teachers' 
College at Warrensburg, Missouri, 
preparing to
teach, I would make my living 
teaching adult classes in night 
schools. Then I would have
my days free to read books, prepare 
lectures, write novels and short 
stories. I wanted
"to live to write and write to live".
What subject should I teach to adults 
at night? As I looked back and 
evaluated my own
college training, I saw that the 
training and experience I had had in 
public speaking had
been of more practical value to me 
in business-and in life-than 
everything else I had
studied in college all put together. 
Why? Because it had wiped out my 
timidity and lack
of confidence and given me the 
courage and assurance to deal with 
people. It had also
made clear that leadership usually 
gravitates to the man who can get up 
and say what
he thinks
I applied for a position teaching 
public speaking in the night 
extension courses both at
Columbia University and New York 
University, but these universities 
decided they could
struggle along somehow without my 
help.
I was disappointed then-but I now 
thank God that they did turn me 
down, because I
started teaching in Y.M.C.A. night 
schools, where I had to show 
concrete results and
show them quickly. What a 
challenge that was! These adults 
didn't come to my classes
because they wanted college credits 
or social prestige. They came for one 
reason only:
they wanted to solve their problems. 
They wanted to be able to stand up 
on their own
feet and say a few words at a 
business meeting without fainting 
from fright. Salesmen
wanted to be able to call on a tough 
customer without having to walk 
around the block
three times to get up courage. They 
wanted to develop poise and selfconfidence. They
wanted to get ahead in business. 
They wanted to have more money 
for their families.
And since they were paying their 
tuition on an installment basis-and 
they stopped paying
if they didn't get results-and since I 
was being paid, not a salary, but a 
percentage of
the profits, I had to be practical if I 
wanted to eat.
I felt at the time that I was teaching 
under a handicap, but I realise now 
that I was
getting priceless training. I had to 
motivate my students. I had to help 
them solve their
problems.
I had to make each session so 
inspiring that they wanted to 
continue coming.
It was exciting work. I loved it. I was 
astounded at how quickly these 
business men
developed self-confidence and how 
quickly many of them secured 
promotions and
increased pay. The classes were 
succeeding far beyond my most 
optimistic hopes.
Within three seasons, the Y.M.C.A.s, 
which had refused to pay me five 
dollars a night in
salary, were paying me thirty dollars 
a night on a percentage basis. At 
first, I taught
only public speaking, but, as the 
years went by, I saw that these 
adults also needed the
ability to win friends and influence 
people. Since I couldn't find an 
adequate textbook
on human relations, I wrote one 
myself. It was written-no, it wasn't 
written in the usual
way. It grew and evolved out of the 
experiences of the adults in these 
classes. I called it
How to Win Friends and Influence 
People.
Since it was written solely as a 
textbook for my own adult classes, 
and since I had
written four other books that no one 
had ever heard of, I never dreamed 
that it would
have a large sale: I am probably one 
of the most astonished authors now 
living.
As the years went by, I realised that 
another one of the biggest problems 
of these adults
was worry. A large majority of my 
students were business menexecutives, salesmen,
engineers, accountants: a cross 
section of all the trades and 
professions-and most of
them had problems! There were 
women in the classes-business 
women and housewives.
They, too, had problems! Clearly, 
what I needed was a textbook on 
how to conquer
worry-so again I tried to find one. I 
went to New York's great public 
library at Fifth
Avenue and Forty-second Street and 
discovered to my astonishment that 
this library had
only twenty-two books listed under 
the title WORRY. I also noticed, to 
my amusement,
that it had one hundred and eightynine books listed under WORMS. 
Almost nine times
as many books about worms as 
about worry! Astounding, isn't it? 
Since worry is one of
the biggest problems facing 
mankind, you would think, wouldn't 
you, that every high
school and college in the land would 
give a course on "How to Stop 
Worrying"?
