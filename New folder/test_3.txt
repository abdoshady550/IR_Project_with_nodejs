Part One - Fundamental Facts You 
Should Know About Worry
Chapter 1 - Live in "Day-tight 
Compartments"
In the spring of 1871, a young man 
picked up a book and read twentyone words that
had a profound effect on his future. 
A medical student at the Montreal 
General
Hospital, he was worried about 
passing the final examination, 
worried about what to do,
where to go, how to build up a 
practice, how to make a living.
The twenty-one words that this 
young medical student read in 1871 
helped him to
become the most famous physician 
of his generation. He organised the 
world-famous
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. 
He became Regius Professor of 
Medicine at Oxfordthe highest 
honour that can be bestowed upon 
any medical man in the British 
Empire.
He was knighted by the King of 
England. When he died, two huge 
volumes containing
1,466 pages were required to tell the 
story of his life.
His name was Sir William Osier. 
Here are the twenty-one words that 
he read in the
spring of 1871-twenty-one words 
from Thomas Carlyle that helped 
him lead a life free
from worry: "Our main business is 
not to see what lies dimly at a 
distance, but to do
what lies clearly at hand."
Forty-two years later, on a soft 
spring night when the tulips were 
blooming on the
campus, this man, Sir William Osier, 
addressed the students of Yale 
University. He told
those Yale students that a man like 
himself who had been a professor in 
four universities
and had written a popular book was 
supposed to have "brains of a special 
quality". He
declared that that was untrue. He 
said that his intimate friends knew 
that his brains
were "of the most mediocre 
character".
What, then, was the secret of his 
success? He stated that it was owing 
to what he called
living in "day-tight compartments." 
What did he mean by that? A few 
months before he
spoke at Yale, Sir William Osier had 
crossed the Atlantic on a great ocean 
liner where
the captain standing on the bridge, 
could press a button and-presto!-
there was a
clanging of machinery and various 
parts of the ship were immediately 
shut off from one
another-shut off into watertight 
compartments. "Now each one of 
you," Dr. Osier said to
those Yale students, "is a much more 
marvelous organisation than the 
great liner, and
bound on a longer voyage. What I 
urge is that you so learn to control 
the machinery as
to live with 'day-tight 
compartments' as the most certain 
way to ensure safety on the
voyage. Get on the bridge, and see 
that at least the great bulkheads are 
in working
order. Touch a button and hear, at 
every level of your life, the iron 
doors shutting out
the Past-the dead yesterdays. Touch 
another and shut off, with a metal 
curtain, the
Future -the unborn tomorrows. 
Then you are safe-safe for today! ... 
Shut off the past!
Let the dead past bury its dead. ...
Shut out the yesterdays which have 
lighted fools the
way to dusty death. ... The load of 
tomorrow, added to that of 
yesterday, carried
today, makes the strongest falter. 
Shut off the future as tightly as the 
past. ... The
future is today. ... There is no 
tomorrow. The day of man's 
salvation is now. Waste of
energy, mental distress, nervous 
worries dog the steps of a man who 
is anxious about
the future. ... Shut close, then the 
great fore and aft bulkheads, and 
prepare to
cultivate the habit of life of 'daytight compartments'."
Did Dr. Osier mean to say that we 
should not make any effort to 
prepare for tomorrow?
No. Not at all. But he did go on in 
that address to say that the best 
possible way to
prepare for tomorrow is to 
concentrate with all your 
intelligence, all your enthusiasm,
on doing today's work superbly 
today. That is the only possible way 
you can prepare for
the future.
Sir William Osier urged the students 
at Yale to begin the day with Christ's 
prayer: "Give
us this day our daily bread."
Remember that that prayer asks 
only for today's bread. It doesn't 
complain about the
stale bread we had to eat yesterday; 
and it doesn't say: "Oh, God, it has 
been pretty dry
out in the wheat belt lately and we 
may have another drought-and then 
how will I get
bread to eat next autumn-or 
suppose I lose my job-oh, God, how 
could I get bread
then?"
No, this prayer teaches us to ask for 
today's bread only. Today's bread is 
the only kind of
bread you can possibly eat.
Years ago, a penniless philosopher 
was wandering through a stony 
country where the
people had a hard time making a 
living. One day a crowd gathered 
about him on a hill,
and he gave what is probably the 
most-quoted speech ever delivered 
anywhere at any
time. This speech contains twentysix words that have gone ringing 
down across the
centuries: "Take therefore no 
thought for the morrow; for the 
morrow shall take
thought for the things of itself. 
Sufficient unto the day is the evil 
thereof."
Many men have rejected those 
words of Jesus: "Take no thought for 
the morrow." They
have rejected those words as a 
counsel of perfection, as a bit of 
Oriental mysticism. "I
must take thought for the morrow," 
they say. "I must take out insurance 
to protect my
family. I must lay aside money for 
my old age. I must plan and prepare 
to get ahead."
Right! Of course you must. The truth 
is that those words of Jesus, 
translated over three
hundred years ago, don't mean 
today what they meant during the 
reign of King James.
Three hundred years ago the word 
thought frequently meant anxiety. 
Modern versions of
the Bible quote Jesus more 
accurately as saying: "Have no 
anxiety for the tomorrow."
By all means take thought for the 
tomorrow, yes, careful thought and 
planning and
preparation. But have no anxiety.
During the war, our military leaders 
planned for the morrow, but they 
could not afford
to have any anxiety. "I have supplied 
the best men with the best 
equipment we have,"
said Admiral Ernest J. King, who 
directed the United States Navy, 
"and have given them
what seems to be the wisest mission. 
That is all I can do
